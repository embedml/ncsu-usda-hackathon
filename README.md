# ncsu-usda-hackathon

## EML's code for the [NCSU-USDA Ag tech Hack-a-thon](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ncsu-usda-hack-a-thon-registration-161912186709).

## About

The event will center around uses of the new BenchBot, a low cost robot intended as a generalizable platform for sensing growing plants on greenhouse benches. The robot also serves as a testbed for new sensors intended for field applications. Three of these robots will be housed in the new Plant Sciences Building, a new $160 million project at NCSU that will foster interdisciplinary research on agricultureâ€™s largest challenges. Teams may build off of the innovative solutions developed for the recent [OpenCV competition](https://github.com/precision-sustainable-ag/OpenCV_Competition2021).
